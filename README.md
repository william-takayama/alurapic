## :triangular_flag_on_post: What is it? 
  Create responsive SPA similar to INSTAGRAM, using Angular (library), consuming webservices (GET, POST and DELETE). Featured with register, login and logout. And each user has its own profile to post or delete and even like or comment pictures from others users. It was developed using Angular (TypeScript), RXJS, SASS, bootstrap, Font Awesome and for e2e (end-to-end) testing it was used Protractor and Jasmine.
